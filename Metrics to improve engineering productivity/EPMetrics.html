It will depend on project complexity and the number of engineers working on the project, both of which will, in turn, affect project cost. By tracking project lead times, developers can better predict time to market for current and similar future projects.'],

          ['Churn ', 50, ' Churn is the percentage of time developers spend editing, adding to, or deleting their own code. A high code churn indicates rework and may mean something is wrong in the development process.'],
		  ['Efficiency ', 50, 'Efficiency measures the amount of each engineer’s “productive” code, or code that provides business value.'],
		  ['Cycle time', 50, ' Cycle time, part of lead time, is how long it takes to make a desired change to the software and put it into production. '],
		  ['Open and close rates ', 50, ' The open and close rate is the number of issues or problems developers report and fix or close over a period of time.'],
